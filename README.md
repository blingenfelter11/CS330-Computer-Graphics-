  When designing software I approach by finding out all of the necessary functionality and what the end result should look like. After developing an understanding I will plan how I will accomplish the task successfully. This project took me sometime and research to figure out. I enjoyed how we built it step by step every week adding new features. 
  
  I beleive this class made me a better developer. Having to figure out how to make the code work and what to add to it was a fun excersise. The milestones were great to delve into C++ programming and I gained a better understanding of how it works and gained a level of comfort. I will apply the lessons I loearned in this class to my future educational and proffesional projects.
